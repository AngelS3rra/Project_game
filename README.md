# Individual Project
In this repository, you'll find a video game project created by individuals.

In this game, you play as a warrior on a quest for riches, so you must collect the coins you find along the way to achieve your goal.
The character has its respective animations for resting, walking, and jumping, all running at 10 fps, just as the coins have their respective animations at the same number of fps.

The project used 2D Pixel Art Assets, which included various types of land and plants, there were also signs and another medium used was the Meta flag.

Below is a demonstration of the assets used:
